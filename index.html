	<h1> History </h1>
	<p> 
	Our company was founded in the mid-1990s by David Thurston, our current owner and CEO. The advent of Durham House of Pets was inspired by David's passion for animals, and his wish to serve those that share the same zeal. Originally, expansion was not the goal of the company; David simply saw a void in the pet store market around the Durham area, but eventually our scope increased with more and more success. More than twenty years later, Durham House of Pets is a marquee pet store in New England with two regional offices in Manchester, NH, and Boston, MA.

	<h1> Why Use Us? </h1>
	<p> 
	The reason to shop at Durham House of Pets over any other pet store is really quite simple... Not only do we offer the best products in New England, and perhaps the nation as a whole, but our staff is unrivaled in terms of knowledge regarding domestic animals of all types. They pride themselves on the ability to sell people the products that their pets need, as well as provide veterinary services for a price well below average.
